Title: Fix Translation Sidebar History Overwrite
Status: DONE
Owner: Miles

START LOG

Timestamp: 2026-01-04 13:00

Current behavior:

- Translation sidebar transcripts appear "broken" or flash/disappear because new segments from non-cumulative STT engines (like Deepgram) overwrite previous ones instead of appending.

Plan and scope:

- Modify `setTranscriptions` logic in `PageClientImpl.tsx` to handle both cumulative (WebSpeech) and chunked (Deepgram) inputs.
- Implement intelligent appending/replacing based on text overlap.

Files expected to change:

- app/rooms/[roomName]/PageClientImpl.tsx

END LOG

Timestamp: 2026-01-04 13:10

Summary of what actually changed:

- Updated `setTranscriptions` state update logic in `PageClientImpl.tsx`.
- Implemented a check to see if new text extends existing text (replace) or is new (append).
- This ensures history is preserved for 1-second chunks from Deepgram while supporting cumulative updates from WebSpeech.

Files actually modified:

- app/rooms/[roomName]/PageClientImpl.tsx

How it was tested:

- npm run build (Verified clean build)
- npm run lint (Verified code quality)

Status: DONE
Owner: Miles
Related repo or service: Orbit

START LOG

Timestamp: 2026-01-06 00:58
Current behavior or state:
- All transcription engines (WebSpeech, Deepgram, Gemini) use default audio input devices or "auto" detection.

Plan and scope for this task:
- Implement audio device enumeration in `OrbitApp.tsx`.
- Add `audioDevices` and `selectedDeviceId` state.
- Update `TranslatorDock.tsx` to include a device selection UI.
- Update all `getUserMedia` calls to respect the chosen `deviceId`.

Files or modules expected to change:
- lib/orbit/OrbitApp.tsx
- lib/orbit/components/TranslatorDock.tsx

Risks or things to watch out for:
- Permission must be granted before devices can be listed.
- Web Speech API may not fully support explicit device selection in all browsers.

- [x] Device enumeration logic implemented in OrbitApp
- [x] Device selection UI added to TranslatorDock
- [x] Microphone constraints updated for Deepgram and Gemini engines

- Added a new glassmorphic "Audio Input Settings" dropdown in `TranslatorDock.tsx` for easy microphone switching.
- Updated `getUserMedia` constraints across all transcription engines to strictly follow the user-selected device ID.

Files actually modified:
- lib/orbit/OrbitApp.tsx
- lib/orbit/components/TranslatorDock.tsx

How it was tested:
- Local production build via `npm run build`: PASS.
- Verified state connectivity between `OrbitApp` and `TranslatorDock`.

    - Ensure microphone is muted when entering `listening` mode.
- Update `playNextAudio` to use `setSinkId` (if supported) for the `AudioContext`.
- Fix build/runtime errors related to Supabase imports and Next.js cache.

Files or modules expected to change:
- lib/orbit/OrbitApp.tsx
- lib/orbit/components/TranslatorDock.tsx

Risks or things to watch out for:
- `setSinkId` support varies by browser.
- LiveKit room state must be synchronized.
